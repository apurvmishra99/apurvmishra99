### 👋 Hi | नमस्ते | Olá | Salut | Nǐ hǎo !

I'm Apurv Mishra, a programmer by passion and a Software Engineer at Stripe. I'm also a hackathon addict and love working on random but interesting projects! When I'm not working/studying/programming you can find me roaming around London, exploring the different boroughs and meeting new people.

- 🔭 I’m currently a Software Engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) working on the Bank Transfers payment team after graduating from University of Edinburgh in 2022.
- 👨‍💻  I write lots of Ruby and Java at work.
- 🐍 Python has all of my heart though! ❤️
- 💬 Ask me about Python, hackathons, Indian cooking and (all)sports 😄.
